# Find the rendezvous

## Description

Liam, an employee at 'Company A,' leaked a recently developed blueprint file.
He was taken into custody; after interrogation, he confessed that he was planning to sell the blueprint soon.
Yet he refuses to reveal where the rendezvous is.

Seeing the potential threat this case poses, Dex and Star decided to join you in the investigation.
Liam's mobile phone was confiscated earlier.
Analyse the phone, identify the rendezvous, and go meet the buyer instead of Liam.
Arrest the buyer on-site.

1. What is the email address of the buyer?
   - e.g. id@domain
2. Where is the rendezvous? (string)
   - e.g. Taj Mahal â†’ taj_mahal
