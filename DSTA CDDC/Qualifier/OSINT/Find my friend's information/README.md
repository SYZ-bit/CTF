# Find my friend's information

## Description

Some time ago, I met this person at a conference I attended with Dex.
I'd like to read his research paper again.
Dex received a photo from him...
With this photo, can you find the DOI of the research paper?
I heard that he likes to analyze and write the source code. 

Flag format: CDDC2025{   }
 - Replace / (slash) with _ (underscore)
 - e.g.) If DOI is 11.2222/abc.33333, then flag is CDDC2025{11.2222_abc.33333}
