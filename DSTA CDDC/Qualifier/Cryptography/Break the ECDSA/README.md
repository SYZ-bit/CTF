# Break the ECDSA

## Description

As BH-2000 was cleaning the office, it lost Dex's key.
Now, without the key, Dex can't even open his cabinet for his combat suit.
Dex needs the suit to save whoever and whatever he needs to, so BH-2000 wants to recover Dex's key.

Dex says he used a combination of English words to create the key.
Unfortunately, he's forgotten some of the words he used.
Let's find the forgotten words and recover the key with whatever the information we have on hand!
