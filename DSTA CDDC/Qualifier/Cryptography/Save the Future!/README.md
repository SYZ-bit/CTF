# Save the Future!

## Description

It is the year 2088 - the era in which the rapid development of quantum computing put the final nail in the coffin of traditional cryptographic systems.
Dex and Star now use quantum cryptography to communicate.

Cypher had intel that Dex and Star would communicate secretly; geniusly enough, Cypher intercepted the communication.

Due to equipment shortages, we were only able to dump the communication into a pcap file.
In the midst of all this, we acquired a bit string that we believe belongs to Dex.
Maybe... we can recover the key using this bit string?
For your information, Dex and Star were using the aliases Alice and Bob during the communication.

Let's recover the key and decrypt the communication.

In the challenge file (leaked_alice_bits.txt), the 'X' represents bits that Cypher failed to obtain.
You may ignore them.
