## Description

We've discovered the server that Cypher uses to collect people's credit card data.
Based on the analysis of the server and its source code, it seems that numerous messenger apps are used to receive credit card information.
It appears that the server has an admin page which, of course, can only be accessed by the administrator.
Let's analyse this to gather important data from Cypher's server.
