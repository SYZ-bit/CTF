#CTF Writeups - picoCTF

This repository contains my personal writeups for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges from the picoCTF platform.

Each writeup includes:

- A brief overview of the challenge

- The problem-solving approach

- Tools or scripts used (if any)

- Step-by-step solution with explanations

- Lessons learned or key takeaways

These writeups serve as both a learning resource for myself and a reference for others interested in cybersecurity and CTF challenges. I aim to cover a range of categories such as reverse engineering, cryptography, binary exploitation, web, and forensics.
