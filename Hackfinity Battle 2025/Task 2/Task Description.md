Thanks to Void's l33t hacking skills, we obtained some CCTV footage from 2022 that might help us track Cipher's location. Our intel tells us that the individual caught on the CCTV footage that day was one of Cipher's accomplices. They were planning to meet up at one of Cipher's safe houses. 
We have this image of Cipher's accomplice, Phicer, leaving a restaurant.
Can you and Specter find the name of the burger restaurant?

Flag format: THM{restaurant_name}, separate words with underscores, and no capital letters .

For example: THM{the_best_pizza}.
